    "QCD is, of course, the theory of quarks and gluons.  At high energies the precision with which it can describe mesons and their properties is essential for understanding experimental signals, such as collider signals at the LHC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the low-energy sector of QCD---the sector of protons, neutrons, and their interactions---is much more poorly understood.  Or, rather, the precision with which we can extract numbers about nuclear physics from QCD remains much more limited---there still exist theories of nuclear physics that are not quantitatively grounded in the Standard Model."

    "In the last decade or so the single-nucleon sector has come under excellent control.  The nucleon masses and the proton-neutron mass splitting have been determined at the physical point, in the continuum limit, for example.  A steady march towards precision single-nucleon matrix elements is under way."

    "Once you leave the single-nucleon sector, however, the field is much less developed.  However, multinucleon physics is interesting for a variety of experimental programs, such as low-energy underground BSM and neutrino experiments.  The targets in these experiments are not single nucleons but rather atomic nuclei.  So to interpret any signal from these experiments as constraints on new physics requires disentangling all the effects of many-body nuclear physics and QCD to pull out whatever may be new."

    "QCD is also, obviously, the foundation on top of which nuclear physics, in principle, is built.  However, making this connection quantitative has remained an outstanding problem since it became clear QCD was, in fact, the theory of the strong nuclear force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest multi-nucleon sector is the two nucleon sector.  Here, the simplest observables include the binding energies of any bound states and the scattering phase shifts.  We still lack a determination of these quantities from QCD at physical pion masses; at heavier pion masses there are still no calculations in the continuum limit."

    "Scattering is a real-time process.  It also formally relies on asymptotically separated states.  However, on the lattice, typically we have neither: we usually work in Euclidean time to have a well-defined probability measure and we work in a finite volume so that our calculations require a finite amount of RAM and a finite amount of execution time.  There is a no-go theorem due to Maiani and Testa that seemingly prevented access to scattering observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, LÃ¼scher taught us how to turn these seeming limitations to our advantage.  He provided a map from the finite volume spectrum (which can be determined in Euclidean time---or real time, if you happened to have a method to do so!) to the infinite-volume phase shifts at those energies that appear in that finite volume.  Then, by changing the volume we work in we can change the allowed energies and fill in the phase shifts as a function of momentum."
