Or, rather, the precision with which we can extract numbers about nuclear physics from QCD remains much more limited---there still exist theories of nuclear physics that are not quantitatively grounded in the Standard Model."

However, multinucleon physics is interesting for a variety of experimental programs, such as low-energy underground BSM and neutrino experiments.  The targets in these experiments are not single nucleons but rather atomic nuclei.  So to interpret any signal from these experiments as constraints on new physics requires disentangling all the effects of many-body nuclear physics and QCD to pull out whatever may be new."

However, on the lattice, typically we have neither: we usually work in Euclidean time to have a well-defined probability measure and we work in a finite volume so that our calculations require a finite amount of RAM and a finite amount of execution time.  There is a no-go theorem due to Maiani and Testa that seemingly prevented access to scattering observables.\n",

He provided a map from the finite volume spectrum (which can be determined in Euclidean time---or real time, if you happened to have a method to do so!) to the infinite-volume phase shifts at those energies that appear in that finite volume.  Then, by changing the volume we work in we can change the allowed energies and fill in the phase shifts as a function of momentum."
