    "Scattering is a real-time process.  It also formally relies on asymptotically separated states.  However, on the lattice, typically we have neither: we usually work in Euclidean time to have a well-defined probability measure and we work in a finite volume so that our calculations require a finite amount of RAM and a finite amount of execution time.  There is a no-go theorem due to Maiani and Testa ([PLB **245**, 585 (1990)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0370-2693(90)90695-3)) that seemingly prevented access to scattering observables.\n",

He provided a map from the finite volume spectrum (which can be determined in Euclidean time–––or real time, if you happen to have a method to do so!) to the infinite-volume phase shifts at those energies that appear in that finite volume.  Then, by changing the volume we work in we can change the allowed energies and fill in the phase shifts as a function of momentum."
